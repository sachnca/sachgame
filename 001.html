    <tr>
        <td colspan="5" align="left" style="font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: x-large;">Doing a commission is the same as freelancing. Commissions are when a small task is given to an individual/team and in the end, they recieve a payment. <b>It's pretty much the same way as asking someone to mow your lawn for money.</b> Some commissions you can sell are: <b>Artworks, Graphics, Animations, Clothing, Building, etc.</b> There are lots of players looking for people to do small tasks for them (eg. make an artwork of their Roblox avatar) and most of them are willing to pay a <b>high amount of Robux</b> in exchange.</td>

    <tr>
        <td colspan="5" align="left" style="font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: x-large;">The only downside in making commissions are <b>competition</b>. There are many people on the Roblox platform that make commissions, and a lot of them are professional, so commissions are highly competitive. One way you can get around this and become a "professional" is through <b>social media</b>. Promoting your services and showing your artwork is a great way of standing out in the Roblox community. Most commissioners use <b>Discord</b> or <b>Twitter</b> to show their services.</td>

    <tr>
        <td colspan="5" align="left" style="font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: x-large;">Luckily, there are some Roblox games where generous players are willing to spare some Robux for those who wish for it. In donation games, people are able to donate Robux to other players via their gamepasses or clothes they made. While the concept of donation games may sound simple, <b>it's not really easy to earn Robux from it</b>. This is because <b>you'll only get Robux based on luck</b>, players will only donate to you, <b>if they wish to do so</b>. A way you can earn Robux quickly is by <b>making clothes and selling them on donation games</b>, this gives players a reason to donate to you, so that they can have clothes. Another tip is <b>do NOT beg on the game</b>, this makes players try to avoid you and not donate to you. The best way to ask someone for Robux is politely ask them, and don't keep asking if they refuse to do so.</td>

Originally, these types of games were made for roleplaying and having an enjoyable environment.

A tip to <b>(not guaranteed)</b> get Robux quickly is to treat all customers with politeness and respect, and to not beg for tips.

It's important that you <b>don't enter any giveaways that ask for any private information (password, bank account, home address, etc.)</b> Unfortunately, there are plenty of "giveaways" on the internet that turn out to be scams. A tip to avoid these scams is to check who the giveaway is from, it's more reliable to enter giveaways that are hosted by <b>verified Roblox Star Creators, trusted people, or giveaways that don't ask for any personal information.</b> It's also important that you do not click on any sketchy links, always check the URL before clicking on it.</td>
