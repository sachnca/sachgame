Although as of writing this, the new iPhones will come out in around 3 months, if you're desperate to buy a new phone, you should consider upgrading right now. Otherwise, it's best to wait for the new iPhone. <strong>(Note: This article may be updated when the new iPhone comes out.)</strong></p></td>

The 3rd-generation iPhone SE is known as the sucessor of the previous 2020 model of the iPhone SE. <strong>With the A15 Bionic chip, 5G service, longer battery life and graphics than the 2020 predecessor model</strong>, the iPhone SE experience feels almost as fast as the newer iPhones. The iPhone SE also comes with the nostalagic home button, which was removed from non-SE iPhones in 2017. One thing the SE doesn't have that 2017 or later models have is Face ID or Animoji, instead it has Touch ID and Memoji.</p></td>

Starting at <strong>$999 (USD)</strong>, the iPhone 14 Pro's features and components make the price worth it. Some amazing specs of the 14 Pro are: <strong>A16 Bionic chip, 48MP camera, up-to 29 hours of video playback, Dynamic Island, and Emergency SOS via satellite</strong>. The 14 Pro/Pro Max has a very large display at <strong>6.1" on the 14 Pro</strong>, and <strong>6.7" on the Pro Max</strong>. The Pro flagship also has water resistance, and Ceramic Shield, which is one of the toughest smartphone glasses ever made.</p></td>

        <td><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: left; font-size: larger;">Even though the iPhone 11 flagship is almost 4 years old, the iPhone 11 is still a pretty great phone. With an average price of <strong>$350 (USD)</strong>, this iPhone feels like a new phone. The iPhone 11 has a variety of features, for example: <strong>6.1" display, 12MP (Ultra-wide) Camera, Up to 17-hours of video playback (2 hours more than the iPhone SE), and the A13 Bionic chip</strong>. Unfortunately, the iPhone 11 doesn't have a lot of features that the newer iPhone have, like: 5G, Ceramic Shield, 256GB or higher storage, MagSafe charging, etc. But if you're just looking for a phone that can make calls, texts, take great pictures, and be of daily use - this phone is a <strong>great</strong> phone!</p></td>

Apple stopped supporting/selling the iPhone 11 in 2022, after the release of the 14 flagship. The iPhone 11 should only be bought on <strong>authorized resellers</strong>. Amazon is a great place where you can still buy the iPhone 11, otherwise you should look for other well-known resellers.</p></td>
